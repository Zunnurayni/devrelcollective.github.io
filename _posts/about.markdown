## Why WADE?
WADE was created to be a side-channel for technical advocates, evangelists and
organizers. Generally, we aim to be a place you could go with questions like:

* "Hey, who all is going to be at Monitorama next month?"
* "What's the best place to buy t-shirts that fit people?"
* "Does anyone want to co-sponsor a hackathon two days before Velocity?"
* "Our Meetup Venue just burned down. Can anyone in Portland host 35 pyladies on short notice?"
* "What's the best non-liquid (eg pack-able) laundry detergent that works well on colors in hotel sinks?"
* "Hello vendors that compete with me, do you want to sit on a panel together at Strangeloop?"
* "What sticker design is working best for you right now?"
* "I find myself in Chicago and in want of lunch. Anybody hungry?"
* "Anybody want a job?"
* "Where can I ship a Parka general post in Vancouver?"

Questions like those get asked and answered every day in WADE, along with a lot
of general conversation about advocacy and community management and just plain
palling around. Developer evangelism and advocacy are relatively new roles, so
in parallel to the community organization activity, a lot of what goes on in
WADE is practitioners figuring out what their own roles mean or how to navigate
making them work in a new place.  What are your quarterly goals as a developer
evangelist? How much do you travel as an advocate?  What is your corporate
conference strategy (booths and sponsored talks? or CFP's and prayers?), to
what extent to you copy-edit your blog content, etc..etc... 

## Who can Join? 
Our members are generally professionals with the words 'community', 'advocate',
or 'evangelist' in their titles. Organizationally, we usually fall someplace
beneath "Product" on the org chart. Right now looking at the active membership,
we consist mostly of community and event organizers. Many of our members have a
different day job, but organize conferences and/or meetups on the side. We have
several others who are students or who do something else professionally and are
trying to decide if they're interested in switching roles. 

One thing we have in common is that we orbit software engineering, and directly
interact with software engineers on a regular basis. We organize events for
software engineers, educate software engineers, take action to smooth
integration headaches for software engineers, and even perform anthropology on
software engineers in order to extract and tell an interesting story to other
software engineers.  

Many of us are, or have been engineers, but at least as many others aren't and
haven't been engineers. Unlike many engineers however, we aren't bewitched by
technical aptitude, and don't expect or require that you "code" or anything
like that. We happily help each other grow in myriad ways because community and
advocacy are harder than computers, and require a far wider range of expertise.

Another thing we have in common is that we're generally incentivized to be
cooperative, by which I mean we're very comfortable interacting with, and
exchanging information with our contemporaries at competing organizations, and
being open about the deficiencies in the technology we advocate compared to
competing technology. Despite the religious overtones implied by words like
"evangelism", our professional success is inseparable from our credibility and
especially among software engineers, our credibility rests on candor,
generosity, and sincerity.

## Who can't join?
We've turned down a few membership requests from folks in positions like sales,
marketing, and venture capitalism. It's nothing personal, and we don't have
anything against those things, but we feel that it's important for us to
maintain a certain... simplicity of intention among our members.  At the
moment WADE is genuinely useful as a means of creating ad-hoc dialog between
community and advocacy people in a wide range of organizations, and for that to
continue and grow, we need to make sure that all of our members are cooperative
in nature and both willing and able to help each other out.

That said, we're still figuring out what WADE is and what it could be, so by
all means if you're coming from a marketing or sales or whatever angle, and you
believe that we can help each other, send us an invite request and talk to us.

## Welcome!
I guess the TLDR; is that WADE is a place where community, event, and advocacy
people can learn from each other, network, and grow.  If that sounds
interesting to you, we'd love to have you join us!
